# RetroPie Configurator

[![Version][version-image]][version-url]
[![License][license-image]][license-url]

This script will configure a standard [RetroPie][retropie] installation to performant settings as they are discovered.

This project is in no way related to the RetroPie creators or organization.  It is intended for personal use only.

> **This script can cause irreparable damage to both your RaspberryPi and RetroPie configuration.**  No warranty or
> liability is provided of any kind.  Please refer to the [project license][license-url] before continuing.

## Usage

To run this script, simply SSH into your RetroPie device and run the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewvaughan/retropie-configurator/master/configurator | sudo bash -s --
```

You may be asked for a password, which will be the password for your user (`raspberry` for default `pi` users).

**Note** This script will reboot your device when it completes.  To prevent this, add the `--no-reboot` paramter
at the end of the command.

### Options

Several options exist to customize your experience.  Each of these options must be placed at the end of the command.
For instance, to print the usage instructions and help information for the script with the `-h` option, your entire
command would look like this:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewvaughan/retropie-configurator/master/configurator | sudo bash -s -- -h
```

The following options exist for your use:

| Option    | Alternate     | Result                                                                  |

| `-h`      | `--help`      | Prints usage instructions for the script                                |
|           | `--version`   | Prints the version of this script and exits                             |
| `-d`      | `--debug`     | Prints debug statements during script execution                         |
| `-v`      | `--verbose`   | Prints verbose debug statements during script execution                 |
| `-u USER` | `--user USER` | Sets the user that is running RetroPie *(default: pi)*                  |
| `-c`      | `--clean`     | Cleans packages installed during execution<sup>â€ <?sup> *(default: off)* |
|           | `--no-reboot` | Prevents rebooting when the script is completed                         |

Additionally, a number of options are made available that allow you to skip any step of the configuration process:
